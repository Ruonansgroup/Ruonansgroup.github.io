Hi all, I am Ruonan Liu, currently a tenure-track associate professor in Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University and the Alexander von Humboldt Fellow with the University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany. Before that, I received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2013, 2015, and 2019, respectively. 

My research focuses on Machine learning, Vision-language navigation and Fault diagnosis. Now I am serving as the Special Sessions Chair for the 23nd IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN 2025), the Leading Guest Editor/ Associate Editor for three journals: IEEE Transactions on Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems, Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence. And I am the Technical Committee Member of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society.
